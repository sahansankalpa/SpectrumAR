## Introduction

The project showcases an augmented reality application where users can see 3D models of NASA's Saturn V rocket, Apollo Lunar Lander, and Command Module. When the user holds a cardboard sheet with printed blueprints of these space modules in front of the camera, the corresponding 3D model appears on the sheet, providing an interactive and educational AR experience.
This project utilizes cutting-edge AR technology to overlay virtual objects onto real-world environments, enhancing user interaction and providing valuable information in a visually engaging manner.

## Features

- **Real-Time Object Tracking**: Seamlessly track and display virtual objects in real-time.
- **Interactive 3D Models**: Manipulate and interact with 3D models as if they were part of the physical world.
